After enduring the dross of the Hunger Games and Insurgent films - and we can't forget The Giver, try as we might - it was looking like it was impossible for Hollywood to churn out a teen-driven sci-fi film about an oppressive dystopian future without violating all the principles of sensible storytelling.

Then along came The Maze Runner, which pit a gaggle of teens against an evil organisation in a surprisingly solid film.

The outstanding sequel dials things up considerably as the group begin suspecting the motives of their deceptively benign adult overlords and head out into the post-apocalyptic wastelands known as The Scorch.

Packed with high-quality action and superb direction by Wes Ball (who did the first Maze), the film does not feature any of the plot potholes, infuriating inconsistencies or maddening logical leaps that riddle its rival dystopian franchises.

One scene where a character's shifting motives are signalled by the movement of a small background detail is more genuinely cinematic than anything we've seen in ant of the Hunger or Insurgent films.

And as well as sporting haunting visuals of derelict skyscrapers, the film leaves you with one heck of a cliffhanger. Bring on the next one.
