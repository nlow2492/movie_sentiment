Those who remember 2014's eminently forgettable The Maze Runner get a fresh fix here from director Wes Ball and writer T.S. Nowlin, adapting James Dashner's teen novel. As derivative as the first movie, this one's a mashup of Mad Max and Night of the Living Dead, with our hero (Dylan O'Brien) and his good-looking friends escaping from custody into the ravaged world. If you're not fed up with the sci-fi subgenre where brave, photogenic teenagers in a dystopian future fight the never-ending battle for truth, justice and the American Way, this one is passable enough—The Hunger Games without Jennifer Lawrence, Divergent without Shailene Woodley. Patricia Clarkson again does a guest star walk-through, as does Lili Taylor, who (spoiler alert!) unfortunately won't be returning for the dreaded Part 3.
