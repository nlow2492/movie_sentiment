The Witch (????) has the on-screen subtitle of A New England Folktale, and its end credits posit that it’s inspired by folklore, fairy tales and journals from the time of its 1630s setting. First-time feature director Robert Eggers and his crew take a practically fetishistic route to evoking that time, incorporating period-accurate language, detail-perfect sets, hand-stitched costumes, and striking compositions heavily dependent on natural light.

Ostensibly the scary tale of an isolated family torn apart by the forces of darkness, running concurrently at all times with the black magic and shady goats is an affecting moral drama regarding the devastating roots that seep from seeds of distrust. Visible witchcraft could plausibly have been left out of the film and you’d still have a portrait of mass psychological breakdown that haunts in its own right. That this is all set just a couple of decades before the Salem witch trials lends a delicious subtext to proceedings, making it just as akin to the cinematic territory of The White Ribbon as it is The Shining.
