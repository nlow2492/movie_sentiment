If you’re taking kids to the cinema at half-term, Hotel Transylvania 2 is a consistently amusing vampire animation, whereas Pan, a misguided prequel to Peter Pan, is enough to make JM Barrie barf.
Hotel Transylvania 2 has Adam Sandler voicing Count Dracula, and Selena Gomez his vampire daughter who has managed to have a baby with a California beach bum. The Count is naturally worried that the mixed-vampire toddler with unfortunate ginger hair lacks fangs and the ability to transform into a bat, and sets upon a course of monstrous education, which takes the mickey out of modern “helicopter” parenting.
